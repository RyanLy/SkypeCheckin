DaskBot 3.0
===

Set up instructions:
---
1. Go to Microsoft bot framework and make an account. Make an app and set `APP_ID`, `APP_SECRET` in 
`/environments/development.js` https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/support/upgrade-to-v3/ may be useful. Even though
it says "update to v3", it's essentially a setup guide
2. `npm install`
3. `node server.js` (Get [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) for development)
